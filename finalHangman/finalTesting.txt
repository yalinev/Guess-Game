Comments on Testing: 

1st:
- Input of 0 quits the game which results in the goodbye image appearing

2nd: 
- The word is guessed correctly in the end with no mistakes resulting in a total of 11 hearts

3rd: 
- This run is a continuation from the 2nd run meaning the player starts with 11 hearts
- There was incorrect input which caused the hearts to deplete to 3
- At 3 hearts, the hint appears
- Note when incorrect input was entered more than once, the program still depletes the heart. But when correct input was entered more than once, the heart does not deplete
- The word ends up being guessed which results in 4 hearts because of the +1 when a word is guessed correctly 

4th: 
- This is also a continuation from the previous run, meaning it starts with 4 hearts. 
- When invalid input is entered, for example 'ae' or 'pq' then the program will continue asking the user to enter a new input
- Ends up guessing the word with 2 hearts remaining, so the new hearts = 3

5th: 
- Continuation from previous run, starting with 3 hearts 
- Since the player has 3 hearts, the program gives the player a hint automatically 
- Wrong inputs were entered and eventually the hearts ran out resulting in the program ending
- The goodbye image is displayed
