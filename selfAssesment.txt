Self Assesment  

Concept Coverage: 15
- Use of for loops, while loops, switch cases, if statements, vectors
- Does not contain the use of a matrix mainly as it was not needed in this program


Value add: 17
- Use of images, functions, self drawn images and writing, ASCII art, new MATLAB functions, exploring text options (example: <strong> <strong> ) 


Incremental Design: 15
- Small changes to the program was not documented, however bigger changes were
documented
- The program was planned out before it was coded shown in the txt files
- In versions of the code, comments were added to document errors and features to implement


Testing: 15
- All functions were tested with drivers
- Some program versions do not run or do not run as intended, so they cannot be tested. But all versions of the code that works is tested


Comments & style: 20 
- Consistent use of indenting shown throughout the program
- Code that require explaining is always commented to alieviate confusion 
- Links are added to comments 
- Variables are named appropriately
