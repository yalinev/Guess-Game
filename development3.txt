For testGuessingLoop.m (Renamed) 

When trying to run the program, it does not run as intended.
For example trying to guess the unknown word: **** ***

Input: a

Output: 
 Wrong guess! 
 Wrong guess! 
 Correct guess! 
  
 Wrong guess! 
 Wrong guess! 
 Wrong guess! 
 Wrong guess! 
 Wrong guess! 

'Meat Pie' is the unknown word, and it appears that the loop is outputting at each index whether or not the character matches. 

The issue was found to be the location in which the for loop was placed. 

The fix (Unfixed at This Stage):
The loop was taken out as this stage as it was found that the code inside the loop was not running as intended.
