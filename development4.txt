Changes Through Development: 

- Updates the word each time so user can keep track of what they have inputted correctly 

- When the unkown word is displayed to the user, a space in the word does not count as a character. This is to not confuse the player. 

- Increased number of hearts because intially 5 hearts for guessing is too difficult 

- Lets player know if they inputted an incorrect letter 

- Lets the player know how many hearts they have remaining 

- Giving the user a hint at 1 heart would be too difficult and would not give them much chance, so it was increased to 3 hearts
